    <meta property="og:title" content="my name is yoshikage kira. i am 33 years old. my house is in the northeast section of morioh, where all the villas are, and i am not married. i work as an employee for the kame yu department stores, and i get home every day by 8 pm at the latest. i don't smoke, but i occasionally drink. i'm in bed by 11 pm, and make sure i get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. after having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, i usually have no problems sleeping until morning. just like a baby, i wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. i was told there were no issues at my last check-up. i'm trying to explain that i'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. i take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. that is how i deal with society, and i know that is what brings me happiness. although, if i were to fight i wouldn't lose to anyone." />
